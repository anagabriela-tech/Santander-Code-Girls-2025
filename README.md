# ✨ Santander Code Girls 2025: AWS Cloud Project

---

### 🚀 Overview

This repository hosts my **official final project** developed as part of the **Santander Code Girls 2025 Bootcamp**.

The core objective of this project is to showcase practical skills in **Cloud Computing** by architecting and deploying a highly available and cost-effective application. The entire solution is built on the **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** platform.

### 🎯 Key Focus Areas

Our implementation emphasizes the following critical cloud concepts:

* **Scalability:** Designing the system to handle varying load efficiently, without manual intervention.
* **Serverless Computing:** Utilizing managed services to eliminate the need for server maintenance, focusing solely on code logic.
* **High Availability:** Ensuring the application remains accessible and operational even in the event of failures.
* **Security:** Implementing best practices for identity, access management, and network isolation within the cloud environment.

### 🛠️ AWS Services Utilized

This project integrates several fundamental AWS services:

| Service | Category | Function in Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS Lambda** | Compute (Serverless) | Executes backend code logic (Functions as a Service). |
| **Amazon S3** | Storage | Stores static assets, logs, and user-uploaded data. |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | Database (NoSQL) | Provides a highly scalable, fully managed NoSQL database. |
